# odin-recipes

"Recipes" exercise from The Odin Project.

This project simply serves as a way to practice the html
that has been learned so far, in addition to reviewing the
average Github workflow and all processes involved. Once this
stated goal has been reachrd it will be revisited to add css and
j script for a more robust, fleshed-out website. I can optimize the
code from there but my time may be better spent continuing through
course.
