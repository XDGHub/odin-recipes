-Added index.html for homepage. First link in next push.

-Second update: Added link "ramen_bowl.html" to odin-recipes. I appologies for the excesive same day updates. Recipes
excercise requires pushes after each iteration.

-Third update: I figure I should stop using the README like a change log
and set one up instead. I also, added an image folder to the odin-recipes
directory for display on the ramen_bowl.html page. I need to start recording
directory changes too. The last few iterations I completely neglected that info.

-Fourth update: Added two additional recipe pages (chicken_alfredo.html
and pizza.html) to odin-recipes. Added both new links to index.html.
Updated changelog.txt. Added and linked two new images of the
additional recipes and placed an image tag into each respective page.
Added new line to index.html (ln 12).
