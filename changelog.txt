-Added index.html for homepage. First link in next push.
-Second update: Added link "ramen_bowl.html" to odin-recipes. I appologies for the excesive same day updates. Recipes
excercise requires pushes after each iteration.
-Third update: I figure I should stop using the README like a change log
and set one up instead. I also, added an image folder to the odin-recipes
directory for display on the ramen_bowl.html page. I need to start recording
directory changes too. The last few iterations I completely neglected that info.
